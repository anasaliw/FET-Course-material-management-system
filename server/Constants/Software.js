      "Integrated Health System is a web based system designed to facilitate the doctors, patients and storekeepers. This system will reduce the wastage of time and energy and money of patient. In Pakistan it is common problem that patient has to face too many difficulties when he wants to checkup the doctor. Suppose the biggest problem for a patient is that when he wants to get a check up, he has a big problem with the traffic. This traffic becomes a cause of waste of valuable time. The second problem we face is the wastage of energy and money. And we know how precious human time is and that time should not be wasted. So keeping these issues in mind, we are building a system that will eliminate all these problems. The second biggest problem is that it uses too much paper. So our system will solve this problem and we will try to use less paper. The system can look after inpatient, outpatient, records, database treatments, status illness billing in the pharmacy. Hospital currently uses a manual system for the management and maintenance of critical information. The current system uses a paper work in which information is incomplete or does not follow the standards. Forms are often lost in transfer between departments. Multiple copies of the same information exist in the hospital that may lead to inconsistency. The project has been planned to be having the view of distributed architecture, with centralized storage of the database. The application for the storage of the data has been planned. Using the constructs of MYSQLI Localhost server and all the user interfaces have been designed using the PHP and MYSQLI. The database connectivity is planned using the -SQL Connection- methodology. The standards of security and data protective mechanism have been given a big choice for proper usage.",

Today, almost every online store offers cash on delivery, free shipping and discounted prices. These online shopping stores eliminate the hassles of parking, getting stuck in traffic jams and standing in long queues for billing. They have also benefited those people who always complain of shortage of time. This is the reason, majority of the people have turned to online shopping. Here, they enjoy easy access to an attractive price range, prompt customer support, and free home delivery. There is no doubt that these are some of the attractive features that catches the attention of the consumers. Although there is one small issue that could make people lose interest in online shopping, it might not be possible to try-on clothes in such cases. Our motive here is to increase the time efficiency and improve the accessibility of trying clothes virtually by creating a virtual dressing room environment.",

Informal employment is typically viewed as a product of labor market segmentation owing to the multiple disadvantages experienced by many informal workers. However, this idea has been challenged on the grounds of other non-pecuniary factors associated with informal work. For instance, informal jobs may offer greater flexibility, autonomy, and upward mobility compared to jobs in the formal sector. For some individuals, the implicit value of these benefits may be large enough to offset - or even outweigh - the disadvantages of being informal. But while these points are theoretically valid, there is very little empirical evidence to support them. This paper fills the gap in the literature by providing a formal test of compensating differentials in informal employment. Using job satisfaction as a proxy for utility, I show that the majority of informal workers face lower odds of being satisfied with their jobs compared to formal workers. Nevertheless, there is a small subset of individuals for whom informal employment appears to be optimal.",

These techniques and methods include Information Retrieval (IR) and Information Extraction (IE). We have described with detail of work in this thesis which is concerns with Information Extraction (IE) and parts of speech finder in Urdu text. Text comprises different kinds of names such as person names, organization names, location names, country names, brand names and etc. so these names are called Named Entities (NE) and Named Entity Recognition (NER), one of the main task of Information Extraction System which intelligently extract entities from context/text and classify them into predefined categories. We propose efficient and effective framework for extracting Urdu Named Entities (NEs) from text using rule-based approach. After the implementation of NER system for Urdu language in computer, Computer will understand Urdu Language. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is most important task for improving the quality of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like Information Extraction, Question Answering, Automatic Summarization, Information Retrieval, Identification of relationship, Machine Translation, Semantic web-search. It is fundamental process for almost natural languages processing (NLP). Named Entity (NE) is not just matching text strings with pre-defined lists of names but it only recognises which are being used as entities in a given context. It is important task for automated text processing for industries and academia in the field of language processing (NLP). We have presented the work on Parts of Speech Finder in Urdu Text (PSFUT), it is natural language processing application and branch of information retrieval in which Urdu text is understood, classify labelled and retrieved. This Project PSFUT is especially developed for classification of Urdu text entities into predefined categories such as Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Preposition, Conjunction, Interjection.",

The major objective behind this initiative was to provide a hassle-free and quick access to stamp papers and to prevent fraudulent activities. With the manual system, it used to take two to three days for someone to get judicial and non-judicial stamp papers issued. E-Stamping has reduced this process to few hours with two simple steps. 34 To counter fraud, the system allows online verification of the e-stamps and prevents reuse of stamp papers. In case of sale or purchase of a property, the value of stamp duty is determined through DC valuation tables based on the data of location, covered area and property type i.e., residential or commercial. This feature helps to prevent tax pilferage resulting from understatement of the property value, which used to be a common practice with manual stamping.",

      "The blockchain-based vehicle registration system combines multiple technologies that intend to provide A platform where we can store all the information related to vehicle registration documents using blockchain technology. Registration of a new vehicle or transfer of a used vehicle is a time-consuming process that requires the buyer (or the dealer on behalf of the buyer) to submit multiple paper forms to the excise department. The vehicle registration system provides a mechanism where all the processes can be handled within a short period of time, related to the vehicle registration program using a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. Blockchain technology enables the development of decentralized business models, but  centralized organizations, like governments, can adopt this technology to improve critical data safety and security. In this document, we present a solution, based on Hyperledger Fabric, to implement a vehicle registration system that can improve interoperability between government entities and be extended to a cross-borders system. The system handles the processes related to vehicle registration, from making to registering a vehicle, changing ownership status. This system can facilitate the information exchange amid multiple states as the vehicle registration information is distributed to each government and private entity in a single system.",

Someone could be looking out for these options and on the other end, a person might have extra room to share with and even earn some money off it. Now comes the part where the latter person might have difficulty to put the word out there; this can be solved by putting the news out there through the usage of advertisements. Room.pk, a web platform (advertisement service) can help both the person who wants a place to stay and the other person who have extra room to share with, an empty house they could make money off, and lastly might be an owner of a Hotel with several rooms which could be populated and become source of income. On this platform people can look for different advertisements posted in the View Advertisements section and look for Hotel Rooms, House-on-rent, or Room-on- rent. These advertisements can easily be posted by other users of the web service by quickly signing up for an account and visiting the Post Advertisement section, this includes images of the property they may have. The service also includes a number of Featured Advertisements which may be posted by the Gold Members, these posts appear on the top part of Advertisement Listings. For the administrator part, the web service has variety of sections like the User Management section where list of Users appears with their information along with the profile status (Approved, on-hold, or denied) - another page for Advertisement Management where the administrators can view advertisement listings and update their status like that of users'",

We, the people of Sindh find it difficult to reach the hospital in emergency, and if we had to make an appointment with our desired doctor. So, we think of developing a web application that displays complete hospital itself but in the form of, while the user using our app he feels like he's actually visiting the hospital, and get all the updates about his appointments and etc. without even visit there physically, and if someone finds something good is happening in hospital so he can get the benefit of that opportunity. We've added 3 main roles Admin, Doctor and User. Admin can manage whole hospital along with staff. Doctor can manage appointments related to him and his patients also. User can make appointment with his desired doctor. By the end of the project, all objectives will be successfully accomplished. There were some unresolved limitations found within the developed system due to time constraint and limited manpower. However, these limitations along with the suggestions for further enhancement can be looked into and brushed up in the future..!!",

This application finds the closest person(s) with the services running depending on which personalized service the user is looking for and which service the other user provides and links them together thus creating an appointment within the two users on where to meet and the transaction will be carried out. This software runs on Android and is developed using Java programming language. The software has three panels in which the first one is for the customer registration and the other is for the service provider registration. The third and the final panel is for the administrator to approve the service provider or the customer. The customer has to register for the service which he or she has to get at home or away. The administrator has to approve the customer and then the customer is given the area of contact and other services to avail. The other side of the project is the registration of the service provider where multiple service providers will register for their services to render and these services will have to be approved or disapproved by the administrator. After approval of the service provider and the customer both parties will be free to access the service provider and the service rendering person.",

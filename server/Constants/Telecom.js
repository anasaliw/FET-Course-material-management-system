Smart buildings have recently become the foundation for the Internet of Things (IoT). Connecting devices in homes to the internet increases internet usage, making homes more comfortable, provident, pleasant, and secure. The proposed solution focuses on a key security feature of smart home technologies: the door lock mechanism. The door lock system establishes security by allowing the owner to monitor the buildings using an Arduino controlled, Cloud server-connected system. Installing the android application on devices such as tablets, smart phones, laptops, and other computers allows users to open or close the door. The goals of this project were to build a modern, easy-to-use, smart door lock that allows for accessible unlocking with RFID key cards and key chains and adds convenience, utility, and security to your home.",

It has become necessary to predict the COVID symptoms in order to allow the people at the public places and the entrances. One of the early symptoms of COVID-19 is high body temperature. It would be difficult to check temperature of everyone, there might be a chance of being in contact with the person which is harmful. An automatic temperature scan entry system with Flap Barrier is presented to verify the body temperature of any intruder. The main objective of the system is to monitor the human body temperature when the presence of human is detected through the temperature Sensor. In normal situation the gate is closed. If the system senses any high temperature (more than 37 degree Celsius), red light activated indicating the detection of COVID symptom. Otherwise, the gate is opened, thus allowing the person into the place. The opening and closing operation temperature, being detected by temperature sensor. In this project an attempt will be made to developed a Auto temperature scan entry system for COVID 19 safety.",

      "There is a growing desire for a secure lifestyle and travel in this era of rapidly evolving technology. The number of automobiles on the road has expanded dramatically during the last decade. Individual vehicle tracking becomes increasingly difficult as the number of vehicles in use grows exponentially each day. Fast-moving automobiles can be tracked using security cameras on the roadside in this article. In order to obtain real-time background CCTV footage, a long and arduous process must be undertaken. VGG16, VGG19 and CNN, a powerful deep learning models, are employed for object identification to address this issue. There are four basic steps in the planned work. Cars can be spotted in each frame of video footage by converting the footage into pictures. After detecting the cars, the licence plate is retrieved. The last stage is to identify the characters on the number plates that have been detected as the readings from the number plates. In order to speed up the training process, the proposed deep learning model utilises the Image AI library The model's performance is evaluated using photos of licence plates from the city of Bahawalpur. Car detection has a 98 percent accuracy rate, number plate location has a 98 percent accuracy rate using CNN model. Key Words: VGG16, VGG19, CNN",

      "Building collapse is a common phenomenon associated with multiple disasters, including those caused by so-called natural hazards such as earthquakes and tsunamis and landslides, as well as technological hazards such as sub-standard construction and maintenance practices, and conflict. Worldwide, over the past So years there have been 181 building collapse disasters reported in 51 nations. 6 of these events occurred in Pakistan. Four more nations comprise a higher tier of incidence, including China (13), Egypt (13), Brazil (12), Nigeria (12). According to DisasterDoc an average of 8 building collapse disasters occur every year worldwide, resulting in 343 deaths/year. Each event killed an average of 38 persons. Every year, around 60,000 people die worldwide in natural disasters. This is despite the fact that engineering solutions exist that can almost completely eliminate the risk of such deaths. We've designed Microcontroller vehicle, also it is used to carry small weights for example the food, water bottle and first aid kit for the injured ones trapped inside a collapsed building or a coal mine until the rescue team arrives. The camera module is used to provide inside visual, We can get the video feed through accessing the IP add or through WiFi/hotspot interface. Two drillers are also connected with the vehicle which are used for drilling purpose. This vehicle will go through such narrow places where rescue team cannot easily go. The aim of designing this vehicle is to save the precious lives and reduce the chance of deaths in such conditions",

      "In view of current situation the COVID-19 has become ubiquitous in every corner of the world. Every individual need to be cautious to overcome the spread of the COVID-19. It has become necessary to predict the COVID symptoms in order to allow the people at the public places and the entrances. One of the early symptoms of COVID-19 is high body temperature. It would be difficult to check temperature of everyone, there might be a chance of being in contact with the person which is harmful. An automatic temperature scanning gate is presented to verify the body temperature of any intruder. The main objective of the system is to monitor the human body temperature when the presence of human is detected through the PIR sensor. In normal situation the gate is closed. If the module senses any high temperature (more than 37 degree Celsius), buzzer is activated indicating the detection of COVID symptom. Otherwise, the gate is opened, thus allowing the person into the room. The opening and closing operation of the gate is performed by a servo motor. And the LCD displays the person temperature, being detected by temperature detector. In this project an attempt will be made to develop a prototype for Auto temperature detection system for COVID 19 safety. COVID-19 pandemics required a reorganization of social spaces to prevent the spread of the virus. Due to the common presence of fever in the symptomatic patients, temperature measurement is one of the most common screening protocols. Indeed, regulations in many countries require temperature measurements before entering shops, workplaces, and public buildings. Due to the necessity of providing rapid non-contact and non-invasive protocols to measure body temperature, infra-red thermometry is mostly used. Many countries are now facing the need to organize the return to school and universities in the COVID-19 era, which require solutions to prevent the risk of contagion between students and/or teachers and technical/administrative staff. This thesis highlights and discusses some of the strengths and limitations of infra-red cameras, including the site of measurements and the influence of the environment, and recommends to be careful to consider such measurements as a single safety rule for a good return to normality.",

      "We have proposed an Internet of Things (IoT) based on a real-time environmental monitoring system. Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in today's world through a vast and persistent system of sensor networks concerned to the environment and its parameters. This system deals with monitoring and controlling important environmental conditions like temperature, humidity and CO level, PH Water, drainage Traffic Noise and using the sensors and then this data is sent to the cloud. This information can be accessed from anywhere over the internet and then the sensor data is presented as graphical statistics in a mobile application. This paper explains and presents the implementation and outcome of this environmental monitoring system which uses the sensors for temperature, humidity and other environmental parameters of the surrounding area. This data can be used to take remote actions to control the conditions. This can also be used to send notifications. The collected data is pushed to the cloud storage and an Android application accesses the cloud and presents the results ESP8266 to the end users. The system employs an Arduino UNO board, DHT11 sensor Wi-Fi module, which transmits data to AWS IoT Core cloud services using MQTT. An Android application is created which accesses the cloud data and displays results to the end users",

      "Human lungs use lungs for respiration. They use push mechanism in each breath. Inhalation and exhalation process take place. The ventilator here we design is to help people during COVID-19 Situation. It is very cheap and affordable. When people suffer from lungs or breathing problem this can be used for emergency situation. Motor mechanism is used to push the air bag. At the point when oxygen level counts are low this mechanism can be performed little screen is used to display. The Arduino microcontroller and a sensor is fitted to detect oxygen levels. The entire system is driven by any low levels of oxygen count. Human lungs use the reverse pressure generated by contraction motion of the diaphragm to suck in air for breathing. A contradictory motion is used by a ventilator to inflate the lungs by pumping type motion and a ventilator mechanism must be able to deliver in the range of 10-30 breaths per minute, with the ability to adjust rising increments in sets of 2. Along with this the ventilator must have the ability to adjust the air volume pushed into lungs in each breath. The last but now the least is the setting to adjust the time duration for inhalation to exhalation ratio. Apart from this the ventilator must be able to monitor the patients' blood oxygen level and exhaled lung pressure to avoid over/under air pressure simultaneously. The ventilator we here design and develop using Arduino encompasses all these requirements to develop a reliable yet affordable DIY ventilator to help in times of pandemic. we here use a silicon ventilator bag coupled driven by DC motors with 1 side push mechanism to push the ventilator bag. We use sensor feedback to adjust the breath length and our system makes use of blood oxygen sensor along with sensitive pressure sensor to monitor the necessary vitals of the patient and display on a mini screen. also, an emergency buzzer alert is fitted in the system to sound an alert as soon as any anomaly is detected. This Ventilator have lite weight as compared to heavy ventilators in hospitals and it is portable system, we can also use this in emergency cases like in School, Office, Home until the major treatment given to that patient. The entire system is driven automatically by Arduino controller to achieve desired results and to assist patients in COVID pandemic and other emergency situations. Smart Breath Analyzers were developed as sensing terminals of a telemedicine architecture devoted to remote monitoring of patients suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and home-assisted by non-invasive mechanical ventilation via respiratory face mask. The devices based on different sensors monitor the breath air exhaled into the expiratory line of the bi-tube patient breathing circuit during a noninvasive ventilo-therapy session; the sensor raw signals are transmitted pseudonymized to National Health Service units by TCP/IP communication through a cloud remote platform. The work is a proof-of-concept of a sensors-based system with the perspective to check continuously the effectiveness of therapy and/or any state of exacerbation of the disease requiring healthcare. Lab tests in controlled experimental conditions by a gas-mixing bench towards CO₂/0₂ concentrations and exhaled breath collected in a sampling bag were carried out to test the realized prototypes. The Smart Breath Analyzers were also tested in real conditions both on a healthy volunteer subject and a COPD suffering patient.",

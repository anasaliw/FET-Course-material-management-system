      "Vehicle Registration is mandatory under the Law and is essential to prove the ownership of a vehicle .It is also required during the sale of a vehicle and transfer of its ownership. At present there are 2.6 million registered vehicles in Sindh and the number is increasing day by day. Vehicle Purchasing is a big decision as well as responsibility. There are Fraud and dirty sales people but having vehicle record in your hand can save you. To address these issues, we propose a Blockchain-based Vehicle Record Management solution for Pakistan. The main stakeholders of the proposed system are Admin, User and NADRA API to fetch the data for the owner profile. Blockchain technology deployed at Excise and Registrar departments allows creating immutable ledgers and send this ledger to each other, so that data can be consistent/ same at every node. The proposed system has been designed and implemented, details of which are presented in the thesis.",

      " As we know that time is a precious gift for us as a person. One should manage time properly in order to gain success in both its personal and professional lives. • We have observed that, in order to apply for admission in universities, Students are required to submit a bunch of documents to the university administration. But we've found out several drawbacks in this procedure. • It's a quite big responsibility to preserve important documents, one may lose his/her certificates or mark sheets. And in order to get them back from the board, we've to pay a specific amount to board (commonly known as chalan) and it also requires more effort. • Getting documents from board, keeping them safe to submit them to the university administration when required is a time-consuming process and it's a responsibility for a student along with his/her studies. A student must preserve its time, so he/she can give more time and focus to their studies. Moreover, university administration faces many problems in encountering fake documents e.g. certificates and mark sheets. It engages both board and university administration all the time, whenever a student went to board to get a duplicate copy of one's document or to submit their documents to the university administration.",

Situations like health emergencies or fire incidents can cause huge life and property loss if help is delayed or doesn't reach at all. The proposed system is designed and developed to reduce these delays, by providing a reliable and efficient communications infrastructure to people and responders and by bringing them closer. The project is based on two android applications for people and responders respectively.These applications are integrated with each other to provide the functionality of sharing communication, route and locations between people and responders.It currently caters to ambulances and fire brigades which can be reached by using application's automated functions thereby reducing the chances of time waste and misinformation regarding people's locations. This system is a step in the right direction in improving communication between people and emergency responders around the World, especially in developing and under- developed countries.",

As of student we ware discus why not we can control home electricity by just tapping an application which runs on the smart phone. That's why we select this project named smart home automation which works for controlling the electricity with the help of Arduino (an electronic device which sends and receive data with the help of programming. For this application we need to choose the programming language on which we will design our app that work both Android and IOS device. Here we can use java or Kotlin for android and ruby for IOS but it takes time and efforts to design same app which work same but on different plate form. For that we select a framework Flutter by google which design both android and IOS app with same programming language. And because it is from google than it is secure from injector. Flutter works on dependencies and also easy to use.",

Students will register and fill enrolment form after enrolling when the date of exam form comes they will notified and full exam form after that the slips will be generated on the dashboard of the student The project has been planned to be having the view of distributed architecture, with centralized storage of the database. The application for the storage of the data has been planned. Using the constructs of MYSQLI Localhost server and all the user interfaces have been designed using the PHP and MYSQLI. The database connectivity is planned using the -SQL Connection- methodology. The standards of security and data protective mechanism have been given a big choice for proper usage. This application take care of the student data and get this data when student enroll or fill exam form when it needed.",

It has made life of every person simple and easier with different social app, commercial app, problem solving app, app for education and marketing etc. Followed by the technology the paper purposed a system that will handle a problem for recording the attendance. The proposed system is a couple of two applications, one for generating the QR Code by entering the student details and second application for taking the attendance and generating the attendance in CSV or XLS format. The teacher will need to scan the QR code of the particular student in order to confirm their attendance. The paper discusses how the system verifies student identity to eliminate false registrations. The system deals with the management and evaluation of attendance of all students. The student QR code will be provided to professor for taking their attendance. The professor handling the subjects is responsible to mark the attendance for all students of the group or class. The attendance will be marked as 0 and 1, 0 for absent and 1 for present in the database of the particular student row in the table. The student attendance reports will be generated in CSV and XLS sheet for further use.",

In our website we have awareness about our property value according to government act of property valuation. We will implement latest act of property valuation in our website, which is Sindh Act NO.XII of 2019. Using our website, you can sale or purchase your property according to valuation value or you can also float the rate price of your property. There are also options like add & delete property, this is very helpful for the members to sale their property. In daily routine, we came across with many difficulties of knowing the valuation of properties, every agent has their own price of properties that confuses and sometimes customer may buy a property expensive that may cause serious consequences which affects daily routine of family. Our Real Estate web app project is a solution to such problem, which give us valuation, a major problem faced by every customer who wants to buy the property. In real estate market, it is time-consuming process to know and deal with many properties. Every estate agent has its own properties to deal and having conversation and knowing them is sometimes difficult. Real Estate web app makes customer easy to interact with many properties of different agents in just few minutes of monitoring our web app.",

It also enables blood centers and camps to record and store the data for people who want to communicate with them, and it also provides a centralized blood bank database. The system is developed by using HTML, PHP, and MySQL as a database system to manage and store the data. The Waterfall Methodology, which is the traditional version and the classic approach of a system development life cycle, is used to develop and build the web-based blood bank. The system targets three types of user: the public who wants to donate blood, the recipients who need the donated blood, and the hospitals who that work as an intermediary to manage the communication between the donors and recipients. The main objectives for developing the website is to educate the community on the benefits of blood donation, develop a Web-Based Blood Bank System to manage the records of donors and recipients, and encourage voluntary blood donation, easily accessing any information about blood type and the distribution of the blood in various hospitals in Jeddah, based on the hospital needs.",
